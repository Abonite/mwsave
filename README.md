mwsave is a command-line tool developed in Rust. It allows you to convert any single file into a 2PSK audio signal using specified parameters. This signal is output in WAV format. You can then record this audio file to tape or other audio storage media, then convert it back to a WAV file and decode it using this tool when needed.
